It uses publicly available data to analyse national and regional EV usage, charging networks, and growth patterns.

## 📦 What’s Inside

- Cleaned EV charging station dataset (CSV/Excel)
- Python scripts for data cleaning and analysis
- Regional and national-level EV adoption insights
- Raw data and source files
- Setup file for environment dependencies
