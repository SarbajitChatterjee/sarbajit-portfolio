🧠 Course Summary
This folder contains materials related to the course Prototyping and Agile Project Management (M4-2) conducted at Saarland University from 12–14 March 2025.

👨‍🏫 Lecturer: Univ.-Prof. Dr. Benedikt Schnellbächer
📚 Focus: SCRUM, Design Thinking, and Iterative Prototyping for product innovation

📘 Core Tools: SCRUM Framework · Design Thinking · Prototyping (low- to high-fidelity)

📊 Assessment: 🚀 Final Project: DiaTrack – A Personal & Agile Build
This submission is a full-cycle documentation of product ideation, agile development, and testing of DiaTrack, a diabetes monitoring solution developed through both Design Thinking and SCRUM methods.

Section	Description
🎯 Core Idea	DiaTrack is a non-invasive wearable CGM patch + SaaS analytics app for diabetics
💡 Design Thinking	Follows full 5-stage process: Empathy → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test
⚙️ SCRUM Implementation	Defined roles, backlog, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives with real users
📦 Prototyping Stages	Evolved from paper sketches → wireframes → functional MVP with feedback loops
💬 Real-World Testing	Consulted biomedical faculty, conducted UAT with diabetic patients and clinicians
🧩 Integration Insight	Shows how Design Thinking (user insight) + SCRUM (execution) shaped the build
⚠️ Challenges Solved	Handled backlog vagueness, supply chain issues, over-iteration, and MDR blind spots
👤 Personal Note	Originates from Sarbajit’s lived experience with his father's diabetes journey
